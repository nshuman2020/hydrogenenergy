    "><font>With the ever-growing need to find solutions for clean, sustainable, and renewable energy, hydrogen-based energy conversion has emerged as a likely candidate to assist in solving this problem. Hydrogen-based energy is a clean alternative to fuel and is capable of generating power, electricity, and heat, which can be used to operate cars, power houses, and more. We can produce hydrogen-gas (and oxygen) by using energy to split water in a device known as an electrolyzer. The electrolyzer can be connected to storage tanks where the hydrogen and oxygen products can be stored or connected to a fuel cell that uses the hydrogen-gas product as a power generating fuel source.<br>\n",

It is important that we review both types of cells because galvanic cells provide a great overview of electrochemical cells and electrolytic cells carry out our water-splitting reaction.<br><br><b>Galvanic Cells</b> function using the chemical energy released in a spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction to generate electricity (electrical energy). One source of energy is being converted to another, which follows the [First Law of Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics). An <b>Electrolytic Cell</b> uses (consumes) external electric energy to drive non-spontaneous oxidation-reduction reactions.

Depending on the application, the electrolyte can be a paste, solution, or molten salt. The electrodes in either cell are composed of metals or compounds with varying chemical potentials. Zinc is often used as an anode and copper as the cathode. The two electrodes are joined via an external circuit. In our image below, the galvanic cell is connected to a lightbulb and the electrolytic cell is connected to an outlet with a voltmeter or ammeter to measure energy and/or current flow. In galvanic cells, we also see a semi-permeable membrane that assists in maintaining electrical neutrality. Using the same image below, we can see that the charge associated with the anode and cathode are different in each cell due to the spontaneity of the reaction.

In both cases, this difference or addition of energy continues to obey the First Law of Thermodynamics in that it is released as heat during the reaction. Overpotential is one of the key takeaways for this module as it allows us to describe specific reactions, even if it is the same reaction in a cell.

    "Using what we learned in the <b>thermodynamics</b> section, we can recall that the associated theoretical value for the potential of the overall water-splitting reaction is -1.23V. The theoretical Gibbs free energy is equal to 237 kJ/mol. Both of these values are representative of the reaction without an electrolyzer. We know this because water-splitting is a non-spontaneous reaction and both the potential and Gibbs free energy values correspond to non-spontaneous reactions. The role of the electrolyzer is to add electricity to drive non-spontaneous reactions. In doing so, the Gibbs free energy becomes -237 kJ/mol as the reaction is driven to occur with the addition of the electrical energy. Given the theoretical cell potential of 1.23V for the water <b>electrolysis</b> (water-splitting), we can calculate the overpotential in experimental settings by subtracting 1.23V from the experimental voltage. Another way of looking at this for reaction kinetics, the overpotential value is related to the activation energy as the additional voltage necessary to generate the water-splitting reaction. These experimental values can be affected by varying current values, <b>current densities</b>, and electrode materials, which serve as <b>catalysts</b> for hydrogen and oxygen production. One such way for describing these changes is a <b>Tafel diagram</b>.<br><br>\n",
    "<b>Tafel Diagrams</b><br>\n",
    "Tafel diagrams provide a unique way of graphically illustrating the relationship between overpotential and the log  of <b>current density</b>. Current density is defined as the amount of current flowing per unit cross-sectional area of a material. The material in reference is the electrode (anode and/or cathode). The Tafel diagram is created using the <b>Butler-Volmer equation</b>, which showcases the relationship between the current and applied potential for the electrochemical cell (anode and cathode).<br><br>\n",

    "Using the image above, we can see three different types of catalysts graphed on a Tafel diagram: A, B, and C. With that, we have an arrow showcasing the efficiency of each catalyst with the more efficient material, C, displaying an overpotential closest to zero. This means that if material C were to be used as an electrode in an electrolyzer, very little additional energy would be needed for the reaction to proceed. In short, this material is very efficient and could function well as a catalyst in hydrogen production.<br><br>There are many different types of materials used in electrolyzers and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. The most important considerations for a catalyst are their <b>stability</b>, <b>activity</b>, and <b>selectivity</b>. We want an electrochemically stable electrode in basic, neutral, and acidic environments; different electrolyzers use different electrolytes to assist in electron transportation. Activity is concerned with active sites available for the reaction to take place. Selectivity is important when we consider the intermediate reactions associated with water-splitting. We want a material that will reduce the likelihood of these reactions so that no additional energy will be lost and little degredation to the surface of the electrode. Precious metals such as platinum and palladium are some of the best-known catalysts due to their stability, activity, and selectivity. A major drawback is that they are very expensive. Common metals like aluminum and vanadium are expensive and display poor activity resulting in decreased efficiency. Nickel alloys like nickel/molybdenum and nickel/aluminum are inexpensive, are very active, and stable in basic environments, but lack stability in acidic electrolytes and display activity lower than that of precious metals. Molybdenum sulfides are also inexpensive and very active, but are unstable in basic electrolytes and lack the activity of precious metals. We can see that there are many trade-offs when considering material selection; however, once a material is selected, we can start producing hydrogen (and oxygen) in our electrolyzer.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "***\n",
    ">We began by discussing the need for alternative energy solutions that are both clean and renewable. We found that <b>electrolyzers</b> and <b>fuel cells</b> can help with this endeavor by splitting water to form hydrogen gas, and then followed up with the necessary information to understand just how and why this technology works. We started with the fundamentals of <b>chemistry</b>, recapping the various types of <b>chemical reactions</b> and placing an emphasis on <b>oxidation-reduction</b> reactions. The oxidation-reduction reactions usually involved an <b>exchange</b> or <b>transfer of electrons</b> that could best be visualized by looking at the <b>half-reactions</b>. The half-reactions we examined were those involved with the <b>electrolysis of water</b>, or better known as the <b>water-splitting</b> reaction. Each half-reaction had an associated <b>cell potential</b> which served as the catalyst for our brief <b>thermodynamics</b> discussion.<br><br>\n",
    ">We connected our cell potential to <b>Gibb's free energy</b> equation and learned about <b>spontaneous</b> and <b>non-spontaneous</b> reactions. Spontaneous reactions proceeded in the direction that they were written and were considered favorable, while non-spontaneous reactions proceeded in the reverse direction and were unfavorable. We discovered that these reactions are the same types of reactions that charge and discharge the <b>batteries</b> in our electronic devices.<br><br>\n",
    "We introduced batteries as <b>electrochemical cells</b>, focusing on components and reactions for two types of cells: <b>galvanic</b> and <b>electrolytic</b>. The galvanic cells functioned using the <i>chemical</i> energy (potential) in a spontaneous oxidation-reduction reaction to generate <i>electrical</i> energy. Electrolytic cells use <i>external electrical</i> energy to drive non-spontaneous oxidation-reduction reactions and the extra energy needed to drive the non-spontaneous reaction is known as <b>overpotential</b>. We learned that our water-splitting reaction was indeed non-spontaneous and needed external energy for the reaction to proceed. Our electrochemical cell discussion provided the ideal transition into <b>electrolyzers</b> and <b>fuel cells</b>.<br><br>\n",
    "Electrolyzers and fuel cells shared similarities with both the components and reactions in batteries, both contain two electrodes (<b>anode</b> and <b>cathode</b>), and an <b>electrolyte</b>. Electrolyzers function like electrolytic cells in that they assist in providing electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous reactions. Fuel cells then use the hydrogen gas produced by the electrolyzer to generate electricity. In the case of the non-spontaneous water-splitting reaction, the electrolyzer provided that extra energy needed to form hydrogen gas. We learned that the hydrogen gas was produced at the cathode and called the <b>Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</b> (HER) and the <b>Oxygen Evolution Reaction</b> (OER) took place at the anode. In theory, the electrolysis of water has a cell potential of 1.23V and we can calculate the overpotential in experimental settings by subtracting 1.23V from the experimental voltage. It was determined that this overpotential is influenced by <b>current density</b> and electrode materials. We used that knowledge along with the work by Chen et al. to graphically represent overpotential as a function of current density for six different materials.<br><br>\n",
